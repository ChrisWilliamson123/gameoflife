## Task ##

My task was to implement the rules of Conway's Game of Life as explained in the document statement. I've added all the tests that I feel are necessary to cover the full functionality of the game.


## How to run ##
* Ensure you have [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed.
* Run ```make``` from this directory to create an environment and install requirements.
* Run ```source env/bin/activate``` to enter the virtual environment
* Run ```nosetests -v``` to run the tests.
